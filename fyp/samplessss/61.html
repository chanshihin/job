This has been approved in the UK and Europe.</p><p>It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.</p><p>All three are supposed to be given as two doses, but the UK is prioritising giving as many people as possible the first dose and delaying the second. </p><p>Results from large-scale trials on two new vaccines have also been presented recently. </p><p>The work by Janssen, which is owned by Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax will now be reviewed by drugs regulators before their jabs can be approved.</p><p>Janssen's vaccine uses the same technique as Oxford, but crucially is given as a single injection, rather than two. This, combined with it needing only a fridge to store and a billion doses planned this year, means it could make a significant impact around the world. </p><p>Novavax is using a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. </p><p>There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. </p><p>The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.</p><p>The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.</p><p>The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.</p><p>It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. </p><p>However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.</p><p>Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. </p><p>Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.</p><p>New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. </p><p>However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first "real-world" data on the new variants.</p><p>Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.</p><p>The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.</p><p>We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.</p><p>Follow James on Twitter</p></body>
