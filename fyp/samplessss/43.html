The EMA said the benefits outweighed the risks.</p><p>In the UK, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the group of experts who advise how vaccines should be used - is now recommending healthy people under 30 be offered a different vaccine.</p><p>AstraZeneca said it respected the decision taken by Australian regulators. It said tens of millions of people had received its dose globally and the blood clot risk was considered a rare side effect.</p><p>"We note that the current situation Australia with very low to no community transmission of Covid-19 was a factor in this updated recommendation," it said.</p><p>Australia has reported one blood clotting case from about 420,000 AstraZeneca doses.</p><p>Australia began its inoculation programme in February, later than many nations due to its low infection rates. </p><p>It is in stage two of a five-stage rollout, where the dose is being offered to more vulnerable sections of the population.</p><p>Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said those who had already received their first dose without side effects could "safely be given their second dose", and people over 70 would continue to get the shot.</p><p>But with about 12 million Australians aged 16-49, concerns have been raised that Australia may not have access to enough vaccinations in the short term. </p><p>The government had previously pledged to have all Australians vaccinated by October. A revised target has not been set.</p><p>Australia was relying on its AstraZeneca contract of 54 million doses, and its ability to make 50 million doses locally, to cover most of its vaccine needs.</p><p>The Labor opposition has condemned the government for failing to have more contingency plans.</p><p>Labor questioned why Australia had failed to secure supplies of the Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines - which are being used in Europe and North America.</p><p>Critics have also accused the government of not being transparent about vaccine supplies.</p><p>Earlier this week, Mr Morrison blamed the rollout's delay on the European Union blocking AstraZeneca shipments from going to Australia - but this was denied by the EU.</p></body>
