Connecticut will do the same from 19 March.</p><p>In Michigan, restaurants and bars are now allowed to operate at 50% capacity, up from 25%.</p><p>Louisiana has done the same - allowing 75% capacity up from 50%.</p><p>From 19 March, restaurants outside of New York City can operate at 75% capacity, up from 50%. Restaurants in New York City itself must continue to operate at 35%. </p><p>Governors have pointed to plummeting cases and hospital admissions in recent weeks as reasons for reopening.</p><p>Across the US, Covid cases have been dropping since the middle of January, but they have begun to level off recently.</p><p>In Texas and Mississippi, two states which have enacted the most rapid reopening, cases have even risen slightly in recent weeks, with health experts warning the rapid relaxation of restrictions risks a further rise in cases.</p><p>Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says: "These states' lifting of measures like mask mandates are quite premature."</p><p>"Though the US case numbers have fallen considerably, our daily incidence is still dangerously high."</p><p>Texas has recorded the second-highest number of cases and deaths across the US during the last week. </p><p>New York was the only state to record more cases and California more deaths. Both of these states are maintaining restrictions, and mask wearing is enforced.</p><p>Texas does have a bigger population than most states, but even in per capita terms it has one of the highest case rates - with about 143 confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p><p>Texas is recording about as many cases per day as the UK on average, despite having a population less than half the size.</p><p>Mississippi has recorded fewer cases per capita than Texas and the majority of other states in the last week, with about 91 cases reported per 100,000 people.</p><p>Hospital admissions have continued to fall in both states, but there tends to be a lag of a couple of weeks between infections and people entering hospital. </p><p>There are hopes that fewer people who catch Covid will end up in hospital now vaccines are being rolled out, with the most vulnerable being protected.</p><p>The governors of Texas and Mississippi have highlighted their states' successful vaccine rollouts as a key factor in enabling them to fully reopen.</p><p>But vaccination rates in these states are both below the national average, with only about 8% and 9% of their populations respectively being fully vaccinated (receiving two doses).</p><p>Health experts warn this still leaves many people vulnerable to serious illness and death.</p><p>Dr Vanessa Kerry, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University, said: "We need to achieve a certain level of vaccination - 70% of the population - to adequately disrupt transmission and allow for a return toward normal."</p><p>Kate Grabowksi, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, said: "Given that the Biden administration anticipates having enough vaccine for the entire US adult population by May, the lifting of restrictions feels like quitting the marathon at mile 25."</p><p>The emergence of more contagious Covid variants is also a worry, with the CDC warning they pose a real threat to the country's progress.</p><p>Dr Kerry added: "This decision feels politically motivated and not public health driven."</p><p>The Republican governors of both states made clear that the economy was a major consideration, insisting that with cases dropping and vaccines rolling out, it was time to restore livelihoods and reopen 100%.</p><p>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
