If we have enough doses, we know what to do, we have the expertise and the structure. We just need vaccines."</p><p>Only around half the target of 46 million vaccine doses were delivered by the end of March. </p><p>Brazil has now ordered enough doses to vaccinate its entire population - but critics say these agreements have come far too late, as other large countries with similar purchasing power are now ahead in the queue. </p><p>In August, Brazil's government turned down an offer from Pfizer to purchase up to 70 million doses of its vaccine.</p><p>It has recently ordered 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine, but the bulk of these will not arrive until the second half of the year.</p><p>The government has also ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine produced by Chinese firm Sinovac, despite President Bolsonaro criticising it in the past. </p><p>In November, he said the halting of trials of the vaccine in Brazil was a "another victory for Jair Bolsonaro".</p><p>Brazil has in-country production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which the government says will eventually provide millions of jabs - but a lack of the active ingredients needed to make the vaccine means that initial production in Brazilian labs has been limited.</p><p>Brazilian public health institute Fiocruz says it has detected 92 variants of coronavirus in the country.</p><p>In particular, the P.1 variant has become a cause for concern because it is thought to be much more contagious than the original strain and has been spreading across Latin America and the world. </p><p>Scientists believe the current vaccines should still work against the Brazilian variant, although perhaps not quite as well, and new variants could emerge in the future that are different again.</p><p>Dr Nicolelis says: "Brazil is not only the epicentre of the pandemic worldwide, it's a threat to the entire effort of the international community to control the pandemic. We are brewing new variants every week."</p><p>Read more from Reality Check</p><p>Send us your questions</p></body>
