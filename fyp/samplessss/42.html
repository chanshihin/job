The typhoons usually bring abundant rainfall to the island.</p><p>It has forced officials to implement water rationing measures, affecting more than one million households and businesses in the cities of Taichung, Miaoli and northern Changhua county.</p><p>On rationing days, various restrictions are in place, including no-shampoo treatments at hair salons and no car washes at petrol stations.</p><p>People have also taken pictures at the exposed riverbed of the Touqian river, a main water source for Hsinchu Science Park where major semiconductor companies are based. </p><p>Taiwan's water shortage is expected to impact the water-intensive microchip manufacturing sector, worsening a global shortage of semiconductors that power everything from computers to smartphones. </p><p>In 2015, Taiwan faced similar water shortage problems and about three million people had their supplies rationed.</p></body>
