But they were among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again that month - following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. </p><p>Most countries restarted it after the EMA said there was no evidence that the vaccine caused the clots. </p><p>However, on 7 April the EMA said there was a "possible link" between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the clots. The agency concluded that neither age nor gender were a clear risk factor and it is still recommending the jab for all age groups. </p><p>Nevertheless, several EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended the vaccine rollout altogether. </p><p>The UK's drugs regulator recommends that people under 30 should be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab.</p><p>The headlines surrounding AstraZeneca have led to a drop in confidence in the jab across the EU. The polling company YouGov reports only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents now consider it safe.</p><p>The EU is concerned the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are based within the EU. </p><p>On 24 March, the European Commission said the EU had exported 10.9 million jabs to the UK since February, but that it was not aware of any vaccines going the other way. </p><p>EU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.</p><p>Instead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export and urged AstraZeneca to deliver what it promised. </p><p>The EU says it has exported 77 million doses to 33 countries since 1 December 2020. </p><p>In June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.</p><p>However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca, leading to supply problems.</p><p>It also signed deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which saw early problems with production and distribution.</p><p>In February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine failures, saying: "We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time." </p><p>The EU has approved the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine, and has reached agreements to buy two other vaccines - Sanofi-GSK and CureVac - once they pass clinical trials.</p><p>Member states are allowed to strike separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed possible co-operation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a video conference on 30 March. </p><p>Hungary and Slovakia have already bought doses of Russia's Sputnik vaccine, and the Czech Republic is said to be considering buying it too.</p><p>Austria and Denmark have announced they are joining forces with Israel to produce second-generation vaccines against mutations of the coronavirus.</p><p>Under the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement.</p><p>However, the German government signed its own side-deal with Pfizer for 30 million extra doses in September. </p><p>In January, the European Commission refused to say whether this had broken the terms of the EU scheme. </p><p>The UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. </p><p>The government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area.  </p><p>However, the UK's approval of the jab would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.</p><p>The UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. </p><p>If it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies.</p></body>
