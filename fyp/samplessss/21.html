they are also a magnet for insects."</p><p>"Mute Swans typically don't breed until they are at least three years old.</p><p>"But it is not uncommon for elements of courtship behaviour to be seen earlier, as happened with this couple.</p><p>"Apparently not concerned by the age difference, this adult male was intent on wooing an immature female, and his interest appeared to be reciprocated.</p><p>"Classic courtship rituals were performed, like raising the necks and turning their heads sideways while keeping their breasts pressed against each other."</p><p>"Until I took this photo I must admit that cormorants weren't my favourite birds.</p><p>"I gradually came to realise they are actually rather pretty birds, especially in breeding plumage with beautiful green eyes and shiny, dark green feathers.</p><p>"I managed to capture this special moment when a cormorant was just about to swallow its prey and the fish seemed to be flying into its beak."</p><p>"Backlit by dawn light, the breath of this black and white warbler shows the subtle colours of the rainbow as it drifts off in the cold morning air."</p><p>"It's always a pleasure when you are able to capture both male and female of the same species in one image.</p><p>"I was very pleased when this scene lined up perfectly, with the drake framed and referenced by the out-of-focus duck in the background.</p><p>"To obtain this image I lay motionless on the edge of the pond, practically at water level."</p><p>"Over the years I have developed a bond of trust with a group of mute swans and on this occasion it paid dividends.</p><p>"This trusting relationship allowed me to capture this most intimate perspective: an infant cygnet resting its head peacefully on its sleeping mother.</p><p>"The female swan trusted me implicitly to stand this close and my accepted presence caused her not the slightest concern."</p><p>"I took this photograph on a pond in a beautiful park in a quiet part of the city of Prague.</p><p>"As a family of mallard ducklings swam past me, one of them began to chase a fly.</p><p>"It highlighted the fact that the instinct to feed is a powerful force even in the young, but of course the behaviour itself was comical from a human perspective."</p><p>"Swallows have to be one of my favourite birds, and my entire family await their return in spring with nervous excitement.</p><p>"There's the joy of that flash of steely blue as they return to the same stable on the farm.</p><p>"This photo was taken from inside the stable, using a remote trigger to fire the camera, which was situated at a safe distance just outside the window.</p><p>"The aim was to time the image-capture to coincide with the swallow flying through the window and I am proud to have achieved my goal."</p><p>"It was an enchanting morning in May and I felt as though this jackdaw and fallow deer were part of some childhood fairy tale with the bird whispering a secret to the deer.</p><p>"In reality, the narrative was more ordinary and the jackdaw was pinching hair from the deer's back to use in nest building."</p><p>"Last summer, while on a family holiday in Croatia, I spent time photographing shags.</p><p>"One of my goals was to take a photo of them underwater, but it was a lot harder than I first thought.</p><p>"I waited in the water for hours, next to the rock where they were roosting and from which I assumed they would jump and submerge.</p><p>"My favourite thing about this image is that you can see the sparkly spot lit by the setting sun where the bird submerged."</p><p>"As night falls, Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour is brightly lit by billboard lights and street lamps.</p><p>"Here, a black-crowned night heron has found a fishing perch on the harbour front.</p><p>"Used to the presence of humans, its red eyes stay fixated on the streetlight-lit water, looking for its next meal."</p><p>"The emperor penguin is the tallest and heaviest of its kind and is endemic to Antarctica.</p><p>"To take this image, I was lying flat on the ground; objects lower than penguin height are less intimidating to the birds.</p><p>"Consequently, they spent plenty of time beside me, meaning I could capture some beautiful shots.</p><p>"On this particular trip, I walked an average of eight hours each day in search of a perfect image."</p><p>"Southern giant petrels happily scavenge on dead seals or penguins or any other dead animal.</p><p>"The petrels are not afraid of people and so I carefully placed my camera inside the carcass of a penguin and waited for the bird to start eating.</p><p>"When it comes to food and feeding, southern giant petrels are possessive birds, and this one is stretching its wings to ward off other petrels in the neighbourhood."</p><p>All pictures are subject to copyright.</p></body>
