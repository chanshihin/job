But given it's also the flu season, how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu?</p><p>They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms.</p><p>Most people who feel ill with coronavirus will have at least one of these three key symptoms:</p><p>So what do you need to know about other things you may catch in the coming months? </p><p>A high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus. </p><p>It is best to use a thermometer to take a measure. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back. </p><p>Although fever is a key coronavirus symptom, it could be flu or a different infection.  </p><p>A high temperature is unlikely with a cold. </p><p>If you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.</p><p>If you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms. </p><p>Flu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.</p><p>Colds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.</p><p>A coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or "episodes" in 24 hours. </p><p>If you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual. </p><p>You should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough. </p><p>These are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test. </p><p>It could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.</p><p>Sneezing is not a symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test. </p><p>Sneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands. </p><p>Remember Hands. Face. Space to help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses:</p><p>More people in England are being offered a free flu jab this year too in the run-up to winter. </p><p>A runny nose is not a reason to get tested for coronavirus, says NHS Scotland.</p><p>Data from an app that has been monitoring Covid-19 symptoms, reported by UK users, suggests children present less often with respiratory symptoms and are more likely to be suffering from fever, headaches, fatigue and skin rashes.</p><p>People with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, although some will have none at all, but can still be infectious. </p><p>Symptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five.</p><p>Feeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection.</p><p>If you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.</p><p>If you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999.</p><p>And the NHS advises: </p></body>
