Fearless (Taylor's Version) is an almost perfect replica of the original, right down to the giggle Swift lets slip in the middle of Hey Stephen.</p><p>The new recordings are cleaner, perhaps. It's easier to pick out little details like Swift dampening the strings of her guitar on White Horse, or the rattle of the hi-hats on Forever And Always. </p><p>Most impressively, Swift seems to have regressed her voice to its teenage state. The maturity she discovered on last year's folk-pop masterpieces Folklore and Evermore is gone. In its place is a wide-eyed innocence that the album's giddy recollections of prom dates and first kisses requires. </p><p>With everything the star has been through in the last 13 years - from failed relationships to public vilification and a career resurrection - it's an impressive feat. It would be fascinating to know how she pulled it off: Was it simply a technical process of studying the original tapes, or did she delve deep into her psyche to find a former version of herself? Either way, it's hard to overstate the complexity of pulling it off.</p><p>One song that does seem to have been tweaked is, appropriately enough, called Change. </p><p>Leading into the final chorus, Swift corrects her pronunciation of the word "revolution" and adds additional harmonies on the closing "hallelujahs". It's a subtle tweak, but it gives the song's climax a little more oomph.</p><p>Overall, the experience is a bit like hearing Fearless on a brand new pair of headphones. Minor details stand out because your brain is attuned to the novelty of having "a new thing". A week from now, the new versions will seem indistinguishable from the originals.</p><p>And that is the point. Swift's decision to re-make her old music isn't an exercise in vanity, it's about taking back control.</p><p>The backstory is complicated - but here's a brief overview: Swift's recording career started in 2005, when she signed a 12-year deal with Nashville's Big Machine Recordings. Her first album went seven-times platinum in the US and after switching lanes to pop music on 2012's Red, she became a global superstar in the process.</p><p>In 2018, she signed a new deal with Universal Records, and Big Machine sold the rights to Swift's first six albums to Scooter Braun - Kanye West's former manager, whom Swift claimed had "bullied" her for years. </p><p>Braun later sold the rights to an investment fund for an estimated $300m, although he reportedly retains a financial interest in the music.</p><p>Swift was incensed that he would profit from her records, characterising the sale as an act of aggression that "stripped me of my life's work".</p><p>She immediately began blocking requests for her old songs to be used in films and TV shows - thwarting one potential source of revenue - and vowed to re-record her back catalogue entirely.</p><p>In doing so, she regains control of her songs - with the hope that the new versions will "replace" the originals on streaming services and download stores. </p><p>So far, the plan seems to be working. Dedicated Swifties have flocked to the new version of Fearless, sending it to number one on iTunes within hours of its release. </p><p>They've been enticed by the inclusion of 14 bonus tracks, six of which are previously-unreleased songs from the era. (Among them is the casually-scathing Mr Perfectly Fine, supposedly written about her relationship with Joe Jonas, which the star's wife Sophie Turner has described as "not NOT a bop").</p><p>But once the excitement settles down, will fans stick with the new recordings, or go back to the beloved originals? Swift will undoubtedly be watching to see what happens next.</p><p>NME: "Swift never cringes away from her younger self. Instead, she revisits the songs with kindness and affection, celebrating the success of her teenage releases."</p><p>Variety: "The 18-year-old Taylor Swift is a great place to visit, but Folklore and Evermore are the places you'll want to return to and live, unless you have an especially strong sentimental attachment to Fearless."</p><p>Clash: "Like a restored photograph brightening from black and white into colour, Fearless (Taylor's Version) is the same, but better."</p><p>The Guardian: "Swift has resisted any temptation to alter the songs' pop-country arrangements or lyrics, even when the latter could have used a nip and tuck."</p><p>LA Times: "As for the lightweight bonus material... none of it argues that it deserved a place on Fearless, though Mr Perfectly Fine comes close."</p><p>The Telegraph: "Fearless was always an exceptionally fine album of country-pop songs, detailing the romantic fixations of a wholesome teenage American girl on the verge of adulthood, and guess what? It still is."</p><p>Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.</p></body>
